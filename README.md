    <p1>Everyone knows the three types that are fire, water, or grass  Then there was the time we got Pikachu and Evee as starters of either the switch or the original Pokemon Yellow. However, out of the sheer number of them, who is my favorite? Who do I consider to be the best starter? Whether it be by impact, looks, or even type there will never be a starter like charmander (biased decision). Before I begin with my rant, here is a link to reliable website where you can do your own research before you just agree with what I say, it is called bulbapedia:

    <h1>Why Charmander is the Best Pokemon Starter</h1>
    <p>My argument for why Charmander is the best Pokemon starter revolves around a combination of factors, including its design, competitive viability, and the personal connection players often form with it.</p>
    <h2>1. Iconic Design</h2>
    <p>Charmander is an iconic Pokemon with a charming design. Its orange color, blue eyes, and a flame burning at the tip of its tail make it instantly recognizable and endearing. Its simple yet memorable appearance has made it a fan favorite for generations.</p>
    <h2>2. Evolutionary Potential</h2>
    <p>Charmander evolves into Charmeleon and then into Charizard, a powerful Fire/Flying-type Pokemon. Charizard is one of the most popular and powerful Pokemon in the franchise, making the Charmander line a great choice for those who want a strong and versatile team member.</p>
    <h2>3. Competitive Strength</h2>
    <p>Charizard, the final evolution of Charmander, has been a competitive powerhouse in both the mainline games and the competitive scene. Its Fire/Flying typing gives it access to a wide range of moves, making it capable of countering various types of opponents.</p>
    <!-- Include additional points as needed -->
    <p>While the choice of the best Pokemon starter is subjective and can vary from person to person, the points above make a strong case for Charmander's status as a beloved and iconic starter Pokemon in the franchise. Ultimately, the best starter depends on individual preferences and playstyles, but Charmander's enduring popularity is a testament to its appeal.</p>
